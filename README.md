# Password Generator

You guys need a password ? I've got you covered ! Just launch my app, put the options and the length you need and just hit the `Create Password` button.
Once you're ok with the result, just click the `copy` icon underneath the freshly created password and you'll be able to paste it anywhere you need 😎
## Deployment 🛫

The project is live on Netlify, you can try out the different breakpoints 😉
